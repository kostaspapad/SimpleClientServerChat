Secure Chat Protocol 
•
2 Clients connect to a server 
•
Once connected, each 
client generates their public and private keys locally.  
•
The public key sent to the server and is set so when a user clicks their name any 
messages sent will be encrypted with that public key. 
•
The private key remains only in the client program

•
When message is sent out, the client program downloads the public key and 
encrypts the intended message and then applies the digital signature which is 
created with the private key and then sends the encrypted message out. 
•
When the packet is received by the specified person, the client program 
automatically applies the private key on the text and outputs the message so that 
the user can see it decrypted and then double checks the digital signature with the 
public key.  
•
Once completed with each step we have successfully transmitted a secure message
